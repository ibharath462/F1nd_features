F1nd originally was born when myself and some of my roommates had trouble switching between the apps to F1nd the meaning of words in the article we read / wiki’s we skimmed and news feeds we scrolled. There were plenty of apps in the play store that could F1nd the meaning in the same window but I decided to make one in my leisure time. I did a crude version of the app which would popup the meaning on copying a word , needed you should run my app in the background. The app would just listen to the clipboard changes and would get the meaning of the word from the database, which made it completely offline. The initial data-set was so restricted it didn’t have much of the day2day words in it, more on it later. As time progressed I was in a stage to release the app on the play store from my friend’s developer account.

Attached are the screenshots,
